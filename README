# Snake Game Using Pygame

A classic Snake game built with Pygame, featuring simple mechanics like snake movement, food consumption, and growth, as well as collision detection with the snake's body and the game boundaries.

## Features:
- **Snake Movement:** Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- **Snake Growth:** The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- **Increasing Difficulty:** The snake's speed increases as it grows longer, making the game more challenging.
- **Game Over Condition:** The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Game Restart:** Press `R` to restart the game after a game over. Press `Esc` to quit the game.

## How to Play:
1. Run the game by executing the `SnakeGame.py` script.
2. Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to navigate the snake.
3. Eat the magenta-colored food to grow the snake's length.
4. Avoid crashing into walls or the snake's own body.
5. The snake's speed will increase as it eats more food.
6. When the game ends, press `R` to play again or `Esc` to quit.
